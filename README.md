# Glycolysis-Model

This model was created using COPASI in around October - December 2020 to learn more about biological modelling, metabolism, and gene regulation. When run, it dynamically simulates concentrations of different compounds as glycolysis progresses, including a diagram to illustrate relative changes. Data was obtained from online research papers (https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/febs.13237). An accompanying video explains concepts in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner was also made to further my understanding of biological modelling and biological concepts, however the file is too large to upload.

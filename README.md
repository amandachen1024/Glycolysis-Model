# Glycolysis-Model

This model was created using COPASI in around October - December 2020 to learn more about biological modelling, metabolism, and gene regulation. Data was obtained from online research papers (https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/febs.13237). An accompanying video that explains concepts in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner was also made to further my understanding of biological modelling and biological concepts.
